    "message_from_the_general_manager": "The British rule in Kumaon lasted for almost one and a half centuries. It saw several remarkable officials and bureaucrats take charge of the daily lives of the people with finesse and efficiency. Some of the great names that come into mind are Sir Henry Ramsay and George William Traill.",
    "prologue": "When I was trekking on the Pindari Glacier last year in November, looking at the glacier the thoughts emerged for the Pindari Kanda Traill's Pass, which is a mountain pass through the Himalayas located between Nanda Devi and Nanda Kot peaks in the Uttarakhand state in the districts of Pithoragarh and Bageshwar in India, and the local tales which are famous about the route and travel which Traill took at that time. G. W. Traill was posted as Commissioner of erstwhile Kumaon between 1815 to 1836. I became curious to know about the story behind the pass and how it got that name.",
    "outstanding_leaders_achievements": "Under the guidance of these outstanding leaders, several historic feats were achieved in Kumaon in the form of various buildings and institutions. Even after 75 years of our independence, marks of many of these can still be seen in various places of Kumaon.",
    "kumaon_region_of_himalayas": "Everywhere in the Kumaon region of Himalayas, the British had left their imprints which are still available and are the parts of the talks of the people. Similar is the story of Sir H. Ramsay, who was Commissioner of Kumaon between 1856 to 1884, the Circuit House of Almora used to be the residence of Sir Ramsay in those days, the plaque at the circuit still acknowledges this fact. He was popular in his days as King of Kumaon. Even now there are so many institutions like Ramsay Hospital in Nainital, Ramsay Inter College, etc. in Kumaon which are on the name of Sir Ramsay.",
    "monograph_effort": "This monograph is an effort to bring the most significant of these marks in one place for the advantage of inquisitive tourists and travellers coming to Kumaon.",
    "nainital_city_founding_story": "The founding story of the Nainital city and how it got established depicts a legacy in itself of the British establishment and what is still left of those times. The Raj Bhawan in Nainital, St. Joseph College, St. Mary's College, Sherwood College all are parts of that legacy only. Also Jim Corbett, whose name needs no introduction from anybody. So is with the Sevier couple of Britain and the Mayavati Ashram, which was a manifestation of a dream visualised by Swami Vivekananada.",
    "gratitude_and_enthusiasm": "I am grateful to my superiors and other members of my team without whose sincere hard work this publication would not have been possible. I hope this would create enthusiasm among more people to give us a chance to host them as our distinguished guests in Kumaon.",

    "paragraph_1": "After the defeat of the Gorkhas at the hands of the British, Kumaon became part of the Empire. The British soldiers and officials were stationed at Hawalbagh near Almora. In 1839, the army settlement was shifted to Almora town. Additional troops were posted at Pithoragarh and Lohaghat since that area formed borders with Nepal.",
    "paragraph_2": "Ranikhet had in the meantime become popular among several European tea-planters and entrepreneurs and they had acquired large chunks of land for their perusal. In 1868 the British Government decided to move base from Almora to Ranikhet and a site in the possession of the planter Norman Troupe was chosen as the main dwelling for the British soldiers.",
    "paragraph_3": "In 1869 the British established Ranikhet as their army base in Kumaon. The forests surrounding Ranikhet were declared reserved forests in 1873. Today Ranikhet is the headquarters of the esteemed Kumaon Regiment.",

    "paragraph_6": "Some time later it was decided to station the wives and children of the military personnel serving on field duty elsewhere (something akin to what is today known as separated family accommodation) or to utilize the establishment as a Convalescent station for the sick and/or injured troops. A number of splendid bungalows and barracks were built for this purpose, most of which still exist.",
    "paragraph_7": "A remarkable feature about the bungalows is that each one of them is connected by a motorable road. The residents of these bungalows were mostly from English, Irish or Scottish stock; hence such diverse names as Fairlands, Windy-Hough, St. Alban's, The Priory, Parsonage, Balmoral, Osman Thorpe, Rookwood, Hermitage, Knockfierna, Ridgeway to name a few. The Ranikhet Club and the Holm Farm Heritage are also historically very important buildings.",
    "paragraph_8": "Like any other British cantonment, Ranikhet too has its share of rugged barracks, austere dwelling houses and miles and miles of unspoilt greenery. The oldest surviving barrack is the Alma Barrack, a grand two-storied structure built in 1872 at a commanding height. Built with the help of troop labour, it is popularly called the Naulakha Barrack. Other stern looking structures that immediately catch your eye are the Fitzwaygram Barracks, Clarence Barracks, Convalescent Barracks and double storied married family accommodation.",
    "paragraph_9": "However, the most impressive buildings are the dozen odd churches spread all over the place. Since the European population adhered to different orders and sects of Christendom, one finds churches of various shapes, sizes and interiors, and all specimens of Victorian Architecture."

The slanted roofs have been built of slates neatly tucked together, which have weathered the vagaries of rain and snow for nearly a century.
