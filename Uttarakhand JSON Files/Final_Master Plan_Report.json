The destinations in the circuit has lots of potential as it attracts millions of tourists. The activities vary from snow based to air based tourism activities in the destinations along the circuit.

It is becoming a crucial issue, especially for the elderly group of tourists, who are generally large in numbers for such a theme.",

Lack of infrastructure facilities, such as limited or lack of water supply, inadequate public toilets and baths, unorganized collection and disposal of solid waste, lack or limited network services, would require attention and intervention to upgrade or implement these services in and around destinations, not only for tourists, but also for locals.",

    "Thematic Circuits Section": "3",
    "Tourist Circuit Definition": "A tourist Circuit is defined as a route on which at least three major tourist destinations are located such that none of these are in the same town, village or city. At the same time, they are not separated by a long distance. It should have well defined entry and exit points. A tourist who enters at the entry point should get motivated to visit all the places identified on the circuit. A Circuit connects high performing destinations of a particular or different themes connected by a transportation network, targeting a specific tourist market, and are formulated for different durations which can range from a day long circuit to full week tourism circuits. Two types of tourist circuits have been developed for Uttarakhand which are",
    "Thematic Circuits Description": "These circuits conform to a particular theme with majority of the destinations belonging to the same theme. These include Pilgrimage circuits, leisure circuits, eco-spiritual and wellness circuits, tribal circuit, and cultural & heritage circuits.",
    "Tourist Circuits Description": "These circuits don't necessarily conform to a particular theme and have destinations belonging to varied themes. These destinations are important and popular from tourist point of view and are inter-district or regional in scale.",
    "Project Phases": "The proposed projects have been categorized into three phases – Phase I, Phase II and Phase III. The Phase I denotes the Short term goals (0-3 years); Phase II denotes the Medium term goal (3-5 years); Phase III denotes the Long term goals (5-7 Years). The convergence of the lone agencies has also been incorporated for the ease of execution of the proposed projects. For details refer annexure I and II.",
    "Phase I Projects Description": "These are the proposals which can be immediately taken by district administration for implementation. These projects do not require the preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR). Most of the components of the projects proposed under Phase I are related to improvement of infrastructure provisions for the tourists such as benches, viewpoints, drinking water facility, toilets, etc. The scale of intervention is minimal in Phase I projects and majorly there is no specific land requirement. As 13 District 13 Destination focuses on the tourism development of destination and the surrounding areas, the projects have been proposed accordingly.",
    "Phase II Projects Description": "The projects which would be proposed under Phase II, would require land identification and DPR preparation. These are the proposals which would be implemented by district administration after the Phase I projects. The interventions required for these projects would vary significantly in scale and project components, for different districts. The proposed projects would be supported by information on project components, required land area, available and broad cost estimate.",
    "Phase III Projects Description": "Phase III projects would be proposed at a conceptual level. These projects can be considered for further studies by the district administration and DPR can be prepared at a later stage if found suitable. Verification of the feasibility and land availability for the proposed project can also be undertaken by the concerned authorities."

The Cell comprises of a dashboard and a team of 3 members. A Digital Feedback Mechanism (DFM) and CCTV cameras have been installed at each toilet location. The DFM and CCTV will be connected to the dashboard which will help in monitoring the cleanliness of the toilets. The user will give feedback in digital feedback machines after using the toilet, which will be reflected on the dashboard. Similarly, cleaner, caretaker and supervisor will give feedback in DFM after completing their assigned duties. If any issue/complaint arises, the same will be rectified by the Sanitation cell by contacting the concerned supervisor. UTDB has decided to involve private players in maintenance and monitoring of the toilet facilities. The role of the first third party will be to appoint cleaners & care takers whereas another third party will appoint sanitation supervisors. Also, for the ease of the tourists, the location of existing toilets along the Chardham route will be updated in Surveksan App.",

The site is approximately 1 hectare (25 Nali) in size, with the majority of the terrain being flat. Because of the availability of land and its strategic location, the site can also be used for caravan parking in addition to the heliport concept. The site is easily accessible from the Rosy Bypass and can be reached via a 100-meter pathway. The area on both sides of the pathway could be used as a green parking lot.",

The Kundeshwari road in Kashipur, where it goes, is also linked to the Mahabharata. This place is the temple of Balasundari Devi. On the occasion of the fair, devotees come from distant places. Various types of shops appear to be selling their belongings in Navratri as well. The people of Tharu have a lot of faith in this goddess. Tharu's newcomer couple arrive at the Chaiti Mela to receive the blessings of their mother. Sacrifices are also offered in the Temple of the Goddess of Mahakali. Finally, on the night of Dashami, Balasundari's ride to Balasundari's Doli in Doli leaves for her permanent building of Kashipur. The site is spread over roughly 2.5 hectares of land primarily used by children to play cricket. There is an immediate need for this site to be redesigned with a proper pathway design, landscaping and street furniture in and around the site area.",

The list of treks can be referred in the subsequent pages. The State also has several other treks of lesser importance from an adventure trekking perspective such as the Dayara Bugyal, Purali – Bramhital, Dharali - Saptal, Bhuki – Khodatal. The treks can be further classified by difficulty and grading. The grading has been done on the basis of the average gradient of the trek, the duration of the trek, terrain and the altitude, conditions of the route.",

The climate at Jeolikot is pleasant all around the year. The village of Jeolikot is calm, secluded and a quaint heaven for nature enthusiasts. Another important attraction of the hill station is the bee-keeping center. It is a place where honeybees are bred and honey is extracted.

So beekeeping is the best Agri-Business in current situations, especially for the rural areas, where it can act as a secondary source of extra income. Beekeeping cannot be restricted to honey only, products such as royal jelly, bee wax, pollen, propolis and bee venom are also marketable at a good price and can help the farmers to enhance their revenue.",

    "tourist_visits": "The tourist visits throughout the year at both the destinations. Moreover, Tehri, is a weekend destination for tourist coming to Mussoorie and Rishikesh. Because of the saturating tourist carrying capacity at both the destination, management of rising tourist influx has started emerging as key issues to be handle. The tourist season puts a severe strain on the infrastructure, with respect to availability of water supply, garbage disposal and smooth mobility. The floating population, too, burdens the existing infrastructure and contributes to encroachments and unauthorized constructions, which are incompatible to natural areas.",
    "tourism_shift": "Therefore, to shift tourist's perception of Uttarakhand tourism and offer diverse range of tourist products, need was felt to develop Tehri as Brand tourist destination wherein all the physical, social & tourist infrastructure facilities will be provided. Tehri has a remarkable scope for growth due to its diversity. It has range of tourist attractions, rich flora and fauna, beautiful landscapes, magnificent lake, along with rich history and culture. Tehri being a strategic location for Char dham route, attracts millions of pilgrim tourists as well. Hence, it was realized that holistic development of Tehri and its catchment will not only reduce the infrastructural pressure in Rishikesh and Mussoorie, but will also become a definite option for development of tourism in above two. Additionally, it will also provide an opportunity to the transit tourist of Char Dham Yatra to explore Tehri.

Need for guidelines for development of infrastructure for tourism:": "As a result of increased tourist arrivals and future tourist arrival projections, and with the impetus to widen and improve the riding quality of National Highways, State Highways and MDRs, the road network has seen a substantial increase in passenger cars and heavy vehicles such as buses, trucks, trailers etc. Due to lack of quality stopping points/ public amenities along the roads, people prefer to stop only at the destination and this uninterrupted travel resulting in driver's fatigue together, coupled with widened carriage route and improved road quality increases the likelihood of road accident. A standard guidance document was also required for designing and developing wayside amenities / tourist conveniences to address the issues of easy recognition, standardization and management of such facilities. This guideline is intended for further enhancement and improvement to address issues arising from existing structures",
