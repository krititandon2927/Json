    "main_paragraph_1": "The result is industrialism (homo proletarius) which introduces the ideas of work, bourgeoisie², and the proletariat³. This process not only creates new social strata, but also breaks up the entire logic and social structures, which no longer rotate around the “being”, but around “possessions”. The fifth stage - socialism (homo partner-turisticus) - is characterized by the conflicts between the privileged (bourgeoisie) and the working class. This struggles led to economic prosperity and leisure time for the masses but specifically to the people of rich class. They eventually turn leisure and travel into unprecedented levels of global movement and activities to fulfil their own desires.",
    "main_paragraph_2": "Also many of these studies—though by no means all—tend to draw attention to the low wages, poor skill levels, and, occasionally, exploitative character of working conditions in these industries. Others adopt a more cautious stance, claiming that the labour markets in the travel and tourism sectors are more diverse and complex. There is little doubt that the structure and organisation of the tourist labour markets are becoming more international, cosmopolitan, and divided into a number of occupational subcultures based on gender, ethnicity, and country. However, capitalist tourism development and the growing corporate and or transnational penetration of the hospitality and other related sub sectors continue to drive the commoditisation of labour power and the misappropriation of the human resource in both the core capitalist states as well as the capital-intensive resort enclaves in poorer, “less developed” states.",
    "main_paragraph_3": "By analysing the relational processes involved in the production of an object, it is possible to expose the structures of the economic system (in Marx¹ case, economic exploitation of the working class and the domination of labour by capital). The tensions (e.g. between labour and capital) and intrinsic dynamic and need for constant growth) cause the capitalist system to suffer from instability and occasional crises of over-accumulation or over-production. Yet despite this instability, capitalism manages to regulate and reproduce itself. (Pleumarom, 1994 p:31) The exploitation of people and the large hotels and resorts were seen so that they abandon their owned business, or they make them to abandon feeding their cattles in the land they have seen from scratch in which their livelihood depends on and are told to seek work in those dominant industries. For instance, in the global travel industry, inappropriate sexual behaviour by managers or customers can occur in addition to absurdly low pay, long shifts under pressure, and unhealthy working conditions for live-in staff. Many people are kept in unfair or, in the worst case scenario, cruel or inhumane situations by poverty and a lack of work opportunities. There may be no unions, or if there are, disempowered employees are told they can’t ‘join,’ so they must endure their suffering in quiet.Marx himself would no doubt have welcomed the integration of these societies into the mainstream of global capitalism, although he most likely would have expressed concern at the conversion of hospitality from a ritual obligation and social duty into a commercialised profit-driven industry.(Pleumarom, 1994 p:55 ,56) Modern slavery practices are especially evident in the tourism supply chain in developing countries.",
    "section_title_1": "Tourism as consumerism",
    "section_1_paragraph_1": "A social and economic system known as consumerism promotes buying products and services in increasing quantities. Our incredibly productive economy requires that we turn the act of purchasing and using products into rituals, that we utilise consumption as a means of achieving both ego and spiritual fulfilment. We buy, get replaced, and thrown away at an escalating rate. (Verma, 2013 P: 11). One social group consumes the culture and surroundings of another social group for amusement or pleasure, turning local culture into a commodity for sale, tourism is sometimes referred to be the new imperialism. The social relationships are uneven since one group can afford to go to remote locations, while the other group attempts to support them by offering all the amenities but is never able to afford to visit individuals they support in their own country. (Kutting, 2010, pp. 66,67). Consequently, there is an uneven social connection that influences how social contacts are conducted. The asymmetry created by individuals allows those in positions of power and wealth to utilize the resources and culture of the host community, while the latter has limited access to those tourists’ home cities .due to poverty and inaccessibility. This is a blatant example of discrimination between the communities, which widens the gap and fails to fulfil the purpose of travel, which is to promote cultural exchange. People from the poorer socioeconomic groups have fewer opportunities to travel and see different places because the tourism sector was developed as a profit-driven generation of one’s budget. As a result, this presents a challenge for a segment of the population, as they are unable to participate in the travel industry. Most of them migrate when they decide to move for betterment and engage in labour activities that provides for their daily needs.",

    "main_content": "just focusing on the commoditization of all the resources of the destination to make it well-known and market its existence, it should also acknowledge and be aware of the coexistence of the communities and make use of the resources to benefit them. Small and medium-sized tourism businesses can, under the right circumstances, promote more equitable and long-term social interactions between visitors and locals. When it comes to tourism, residents are frequently the first to sacrifice environmental concerns for economic reasons.The Uttarakhand region has tremendous growth potential. The associated entities should take the necessary actions and should promote tourism in collaboration with the government and with the inclusion of locals so that, despite being viewed as a consumption activity, tourism can also be seen as learning and development activity with benefits for communities and making their quality of life better. Uttarakhand tourism towards showing ethnicity of the place and entering the market to popularize its local products has concluded up with the fact making “everything for sale” which is a crystal clear warning for the residents as well as to all the stakeholders involved. Masses of people that arrive in Uttarakhand every minute in some destinations are seen busy negotiating products on the sidewalk, trash around freely, and swarming around the areas flaunting fake luxuries largely shows how Uttarakhand has lost its splendour as a result of tourism as an industry which is being practiced. The current term in this state is “tourism phobia,” where residents are afraid of the tourist season, especially in the hilly regions where the destinations are entirely overcrowded by visitors.",
