Special features of the Garhwal School include beautiful women\nwith fully developed breasts, thin waist line, soft oval shaped face, delicate brow and\nthin nose with defined nose bridge. A poet cum artist Mola Ram was undoubtedly an\nexceptional personality of his age, for, he wrote poems, made notes on natural history,\ncollected data and painted a diverse range of subjects. The matrimonial alliance of King\nPradhyuman Shah (1797-1804 AD) with a Guler Princess of Kangra induced many\nGuler artists to come and reside in Garhwal. Their technique greatly influenced the\nGarhwal style of painting. With the conceptualisation of ideal beauty, its fusion of\nreligion and romance, its blending of poetry and passion, the paintings of Garhwal are\nan embodiment of the Indian attitude towards love.\nWe know the names of various painters of that period. Shyam Das and Har Das\nwere first in the family tree, probably being the first to come to Garhwal with Prince\nSuleman. Hiralal, Mangat Ram, Molaram, Jwalaram, Tejram, Brijnath were some of the\ngreat masters of this school of art.

The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. To successfully complete a climb, one must return to the base of the route safely. Due to the length and extended endurance required, accidents are more likely to happen on descent than ascent; especially on the larger multiple pitches (class III- IV and/or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs).",

Scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.",

Free climbing may rely on top rope belay systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the belay stations. Anchors, ropes and protection are used to back up the climber and are passive as opposed to active ascending aids. Subtypes of free climbing are trad climbing and sport climbing.

If a fall occurs and the climber is not over water (as in the case of deep water soloing), the climber is likely to be killed or seriously injured. Though technically similar to bouldering, free solo climbing typically refers to routes that are far taller and/or far more lethal than bouldering. The term \"highball\" is used to refer to climbing on the boundary between free soloing and bouldering, where what is usually climbed as a boulder problem may be high enough for a fall to cause serious injury (20 ft. and higher) and hence could also be considered to be a free solo.",

The lead climber ascends with the rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, rather than through a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and carabineers, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such as nuts; this limits the length of a potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed bolts. Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.",
    "lead_climbing_safety": "Unlike top-rope climbing where the climber is always supported by an anchor located above the climber, lead climbing often has scenarios where the climber will be attached to a point under him or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much greater than that of top-rope and this is one of the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The fall factor is the ratio of the height a climbers' falls and the length of rope available to absorb the fall. The higher the fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before actually lead climbing on their own.",

Routes longer than the rope length are broken up into several segments called pitches; this is known as multi-pitch climbing. At the top of a pitch, the leader, the first climber to ascend, sets up an anchor and then belays the second climber up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route taken by the leader, the second climber removes (cleans) the carabiners and anchors placed along the way in order to use them again on the next pitch.

Such huts exist at many different heights, including in the high mountains themselves â in extremely remote areas, more rudimentary shelters may exist. The mountain huts are of varying size and quality, but each is typically centred on a communal dining room and have dormitories equipped with mattresses, blankets or duvets, and pillows; guests are expected to bring and to use their own sleeping bag liner. The facilities are usually rudimentary but, given their locations, huts offer vital shelter, make routes more widely accessible (by allowing journeys to be broken and reducing the weight of equipment needing to be carried), and offer good value. In Europe, all huts are staffed during the summer (mid-June to mid-September) and some are staffed in the spring (mid-March to mid-May). Elsewhere, huts may also be open in the fall. Huts also may have a part that is always open, but unmanned, a so-called winter hut. When open and manned, the huts are generally run by full-time employees, but some are staffed on a voluntary basis by members of Alpine clubs (such as Swiss Alpine Club and Club alpin franÃ§ais) or in North America by Alpine Club of Canada. The manager of the hut, termed a guardian or warden in Europe, will usually also sell refreshments and meals; both to those visiting only for the day and to those staying overnight. The offering is surprisingly wide; given that most supplies, often including fresh water, must be flown in by helicopter, and may include glucose-based snacks (such as Mars and Snickers bars) on which climbers and walkers wish to stock up, cakes and pastries made at the hut, a variety of hot and cold drinks (including beer and wine), and high carbohydrate dinners in the evenings. Not all huts offer a catered service, though, and visitors may need to provide for themselves.

In exposed positions, windbreaks of snow or rock may be required to shelter the tent. One of the downsides to tenting is that high winds and snow loads can be dangerous and may ultimately lead to the tent's failure and collapse. In addition, the constant flapping of the tent fabric can hinder sleep and raise doubts about the security of the shelter. When choosing a tent, alpinists tend to rely on specialised mountaineering tents that are specifically designed for high winds and moderate to heavy snow loads. Tent stakes can be buried in the snow (\"deadman\") for extra security.",
    "Snow cave": "Where conditions permit snow caves are another way to shelter high on the mountain. Some climbers do not use tents at high altitudes unless the snow conditions do not allow for snow caving, since snow caves are silent and much warmer than tents. They can be built relatively easily, given sufficient time, using a snow shovel. A correctly made snow cave will hover around freezing, which relative to outside temperatures can be very warm. They can be dug anywhere where there is at least four feet of snow. The addition of a good quality bivvy bag and closed cell foam sleeping mat will also increase the warmth of the snow cave. Another shelter that works well is a quinzee, which is excavated from a pile of snow that has been work hardened or sintered (typically by stomping). Igloos are used by some climbers, but are deceptively difficult to build and require specific snow conditions.",

    "Mountaineering is considered to be one of the most dangerous activities in the world. Loss of life is not uncommon on most major extreme altitude mountaineering destinations every year. Dangers in mountaineering are sometimes divided into two categories: objective hazards that exist without regard to the climber's presence, like rockfall, avalanches and inclement weather, and subjective hazards that relate only to factors introduced by the climber. Equipment failure and falls due to inattention, fatigue or inadequate technique are examples of subjective hazards. A route continually swept by avalanches and storms is said to have a high level of objective danger, whereas a technically far more difficult route that is relatively safe from these dangers may be regarded as objectively safer. In all, mountaineers must concern themselves with dangers: falling rocks, falling ice, snow-avalanches, the climber falling, falls from ice slopes, falls down snow slopes, falls into crevasses and the dangers from altitude and weather.

    "Falling rocks": "Every rock mountain is slowly disintegrating due to erosion, the process being especially rapid above the snow-line. Rock faces are constantly swept by falling stones, which may be possible to dodge. Falling rocks tend to form furrows in a mountain face, and these furrows (couloirs) have to be ascended with caution, their sides often being safe when the middle is stoneswept. Rocks fall more frequently on some days than on others, according to the recent weather. Ice formed during the night may temporarily bind rocks to the face but warmth of the day or lubricating water from melting snow or rain may easily dislodge these rocks. Local experience is a valuable help on determining typical rock fall on such routes. The direction of the dip of rock strata sometimes determines the degree of danger on a particular face; the character of the rock must also be considered. Where stones fall frequently debris will be found below, whilst on snow slopes falling stones cut furrows visible from a great distance. In planning an ascent of a new peak or an unfamiliar route, mountaineers must look for such traces. When falling stones get mixed in considerable quantity with slushy snow or water a mud avalanche is formed (common in the Himalayas). It is vital to avoid camping in their possible line of fall.",
    "Falling ice": "The places where ice may fall can always be determined beforehand. It falls in the broken parts of glaciers (seracs) and from overhanging cornices formed on the crests of narrow ridges. Large icicles are often formed on steep rock faces, and these fall frequently in fine weather following cold and stormy days. They have to be avoided like falling stones. Seracs are slow in formation, and slow in arriving (by glacier motion) at a condition of unstable equilibrium. They generally fall in or just after the hottest part of the day. A skillful and experienced ice-man will usually devise a safe route through a most intricate ice-fall, but such places should be avoided in the afternoon of a hot day. Hanging glaciers (i.e. glaciers perched on steep slopes) often discharge themselves over steep rock-faces, the snout breaking off at",

    "intervals": "They can always be detected by their debris below. Their track should be avoided.",
    "Falls from rocks": "A rock climber's skill is shown by their choice of handhold and foothold, and their adhesion to the holds once chosen. Much depends on the ability to estimate the capability of the rock to support the weight placed on it. Many loose rocks are quite firm enough to bear a person's weight, but experience is needed to know which can be trusted, and skill is required in transferring the weight to them without jerking. On rotten rocks the rope must be handled with special care, lest it should dislodge loose stones on to those below. Similar care must be given to handholds and footholds, for the same reason. When a horizontal traverse has to be made across very difficult rocks, a dangerous situation may arise unless at both ends of the traverse there are firm positions. Mutual assistance on hard rocks takes all manner of forms: two, or even three, people climbing on one another's shoulders, or using an ice axe propped up by others for a foothold. The great principle is that of co-operation, all the members of the party climbing with reference to the others, and not as independent units; each when moving must know what the climber in front and the one behind are doing. After bad weather steep rocks are often found covered with a veneer of ice (verglas), which may even render them inaccessible. Crampons are useful on such occasions.",
    "Avalanches": "Every year, 120 to 150 people die in small avalanches in the Alps alone. The vast majority of Alpine victims are reasonably experienced male skiers aged 20-35 but also include ski instructors and guides. However a significant number of climbers are killed in Scottish avalanches often on descent and often triggered by the victims. There is always a lot of pressure to risk a snow crossing. Turning back takes a lot of extra time and effort, supreme leadership, and most importantly there is seldom an avalanche that proves the right decision was made. Making the decision to turn around is especially hard if others are crossing the slope, but any next person could become the trigger.",

However, there are a few\nissues that people regularly complain about. One is that teahouses that accept larger\ngroups can be very noisy at night; for most people it's tougher to sleep at altitude,\nso anything that disrupts sleep is irritating.\nAnother involves the decisions that your guide makes without consultation,\nlike where to stay, or route options. Make sure you have a clear understanding of\nwho makes which decisions. Small groups trekking with a guide may find it\ndifficult to secure rooms or even meals in some teahouses that devote themselves\nto larger, more profitable parties.\nIf you are a woman trekking alone with a guide be aware that even simple\nacts can be misconstrued as a proposition.Booking a trek through an overseas\noperator means you don't get to have any choice of guide, but you do have the\nreassurance that they are probably going to be excellent and if not, you have\nrecourse to complain.\nThe size of group you will be trekking with becomes important when you choose\na 'packaged trek'. Some companies are still in the habit of sending over twenty\ntrekkers into the hills with a single guide and a few porters, which is\nirresponsible and doesn't make for a good holiday.\nThe safety and security of local knowledge should not be underestimated, nor\nshould the ability to communicate to your heart's content through your guide's\ninterpreting.

Those who brave the drive to the resort are rewarded with a magnificent sight as the resort rises into view from the steep path that leads up to it from Joshimath. For those who prefer to zip up in the cable car, the resort seems like a tiny speck in the vast snow or grass covered expanse of the Himalayas, as the season may be. The warm hospitality however belies the tough weather conditions under which the CTC staff battle the forces of nature to provide comfort to the guests. The resort is paradise in winters for skiing and sledding enthusiasts and for anyone who wishes to venture out in the snow and enjoy snow sports.In summers, when the snow gives way to carpets of grass and flowers, hikers and trekkers will find numerous marked walks and mountain bike trails. Trekkers to Kuari Pass and the Valley of Flowers prefer to stay on at Clifftop Club at the end of the trek to avail the luxury of hot baths and lavish cuisine. The famous high altitude Gorson Reserve forest (part of the Nanda Devi National Park) provides a splendid backdrop to the resort. The forest is richly inhabited by rare Himalayan wildlife including the snow leopard, musk deer, wild boar, wild cats, rabbits, jackals, foxes, hyena and black bear. Summers are extremely pleasant and the deodar and oak trees add to the fragrant air to promote natural health, which is strongly recommended by Physicians/ Naturopaths/ Therapists.",

Set up in 1993, Known as much for the Kempty falls as for its widlife, the sanctuary lies within the catchments of the Aglar River, a tributary of the Yamuna. The sanctuary was set up primarily with the objective of protecting the area's dwindling bird population and diversity, especially the Himalayan pheasant and the Monal (the state bird of Uttarakhand) which are becoming rare. The white crested Kaleej Pheasant, Snow partridge, Bush quail, Blue rock pigeon, Fire tailed sun bird, and the Whistling thrush are some of the other birds found here, and the now extinct Mountain Quail was last sighted in the Binog forests back in 1986. The sanctuary also has a vast floral diversity, consisting of mosses, ferns, flowers, and orchids. The mountainsides are covered with a dense forest of Banj and Oak interspersed with Deodar and Kail patches. Under the Banj, a light undergrowth of shrubs and grasses cover the forest floor. Leopards, lagurs, Ghoral, Kakar, Lepoard cat, Flying Squirrel etc. are found here. A trek to find the source of the Kempty falls takes you through the dense forests of the area, and is well worth the effort.
