The significance of tourism is recognized in both developed and developing and beneficial agents of both economic and social change. Indeed, tourism has stimulated employment and investment, modified land use and economic structure, and made a positive contribution to the balance of payment in many countries throughout the world. This ever-expanding spirit of travel has lived on down the ages. In recorded history, there have been instances whereby one can know that man has been travelling throughout the ages. From the very early historic period, travel has had a fascination for man. Much of the travel, in the beginning, was eagerly unconscious and rather a simple affair. This unit will give a detail of travel patterns through the ages.",

Perhaps, it was the invention of the wheel, about five thousand years ago, which made travel possible followed by the invention of money by the Sumerians (Babylonia) that led to the development of trade and the beginning of a new era. The Phoenicians were probably the first real travellers in the modern sense as they went from place to place as travellers and traders. Almost at the same time, trade and travel developed in India where the wheel and money were already known at the time of the Indus Valley civilization (3000-1100 BC).

The newly completed railway track in England featured special provisions for carrying people in addition to freight. The rail network in the beginning was responsible for carrying goods from industrial centres to the centres of trade and commerce, but it initiated the process of carrying passengers, which later on became a mass movement. It was for the first time that the seaside resorts were within the reach of many people who otherwise had not been able to reach these places. Initially, the newly formed companies in England were concentrating on meeting the demands of trade and commerce instead of on the passengers. Gradually, the railway companies started to concentrate on carrying more passengers leading to the trend of short day trips. This trend later paved the way for organized excursions for the public at special fares.",

We are now in the global economy and our industries must be globally competitive. We must think globally. Material prosperity in many countries, with accompanying higher standards of living, has made travel attainable for hundreds of millions of us. Although travel can be undertaken for many reasons, the most common are pleasure, business, and study.

The geographer's approach to tourism sheds light on the location of tourist areas, the movements of people created by tourism locales, the changes that tourism brings to the landscape in the form of tourism facilities, dispersion of tourism development, physical planning, and economic, social, and cultural problems. Since tourism touches geography at so many points, geographers have investigated the area more thoroughly than scholars in many other disciplines. Because the geographers' approach is so encompassing dealing with land use, economic aspects, demographic impacts, and cultural problems, a study of their contributions is highly recommended.",

Because people behave in different ways and travel for different reasons, it is necessary to use a psychological approach to determine the best way to promote and market tourism products. Since tourists cross borders and require passports and visas from government offices, and since most countries have government-operated tourism development departments, we find that political institutions are involved and are calling for a political science approach. Any industry that becomes an economic giant affecting the lives of many people attracts the attention of legislative bodies (along with that of sociologists, geographers, economists, and anthropologists,) which create the laws, regulations, and legal environment in which the tourist industry must operate, so we also have a legal approach. The great importance of transportation suggests passenger transportation as another approach. The fact simply is that tourism is so vast, so complex, and so multifaceted that it is necessary to have several approaches to studying the field, each geared to a somewhat different task or objective.",

The intangible elements include relaxation, culture, escape, adventure and new and different experiences. As there are several bodies involved the need arises for the management of services related to this industry and so the study of Tourism acquires a great practical necessity and usefulness. The tourism industry is very fast growing and this industry involves activities and interests of Transport Undertakings, Owners of Tourist Sites and Attractions, Various tourist Service Providers at the tourist destinations and Central and Local Government, etc. Each of these serves both the resident population and the tourists and their management must reconcile the needs of tourists with the needs of the resident population.

    "5.1 Introduction:": "Tourism is probably as old as that of mankind. However, as an organized, regular and multidimensional business activity, it qualified for the status of an industry in the post-Second World War period. Since then it has grown to be an industry of worldwide importance one of the most important sectors and the largest commodity in international trade in some countries. For too long, tourism has been regarded as unworthy of serious consideration or analysis, and as providing only 'candy floss' jobs. However, over the years, the tourism phenomenon has attracted almost the entire world and has become a painless procedure for the transfer of real resources",

Residents must participate in the implementation of strategies and the operation of the tourism infrastructure, services and facilities.",

Participants could include local NGO groups and institutions, volunteer service groups, the poor, women, municipal governments and their economic development departments, tourism associations, visitor bureaus, town business associations, regional representatives of provincial tourism development and any other party which might be involved in or impacted by tourism.",
    "(c) Local Ownership": "Tourism development must provide quality employment for community residents. The provision of fulfilling jobs has to be seen as an integral part of any tourism development at the local level. Part of the process of ensuring quality employment is to ensure, as much as possible, that the tourism infrastructure (hotels, restaurants, shops, etc.) is developed and managed by local people. Experience has demonstrated that the provision of education and training for residents and access to financing for local businesses and entrepreneurs are central to this type of policy.",

Local involvement in tourism facilitates the development of linkages among the service and goods providers within the tourism destination.",

    "introduction_paragraph_1": "Tourism enters the new millennium with the prospect of continued expression and greater importance in the world economy, facing many challenges. The significance of tourism has been recognized in both developed and developing countries. There is widespread optimism that tourism might be a powerful and beneficial agent of economic and social change. Indeed, tourism has stimulated employment and investment, modified land use and economic structure, and made a positive contribution to the balance of payment in many countries throughout the world.",
    "introduction_paragraph_2": "Above all tourism is not only growing in numbers (From 25 million in 1950 to 842 million in 2006) rather there has been a considerable growth in the dimension of tourism as well. Tourism has gradually moved from traditional resources towards non-traditional resources. ‘Diversification' is the buzzword in Tourism in the present scenario. Tourists' attention is shifting from established destinations such as sea beaches to emerging destinations. Tourism has become a multiple activity focused on the integration of shopping and recreation, entertainment and education, culture and business.",
    "introduction_paragraph_3": "New travel patterns reflect changes in consumer behaviour, economic strength of source markets, new destinations and political realignments. There is a new tourism 'wave' arising from developing Asian economies with fewer travel constraints. The trend of short breaks is also increasing. There is also a trend toward high-yield and extended vacations that are purpose-driven by education, wellness or other forms of motivation. Leisure destinations do not provide a greater menu of activities to accommodate the increasingly wide range of interests desired by the",

    "content_2": "If we go through the annals of human behaviour it seems that travel was one of the oldest human activities. It existed even before recorded history when the man was roaming in search of food and shelter during the pre-historic period. From the very earliest historical period, travel has fascinated mankind in various ways. Much of travel in the beginning was largely unconscious and rather a simple affair. Travel in the distant past was not a thing of pleasure as is the case now. The travellers of the ancient period were merchants, pilgrims, and scholars who went across the world out of curiosity exploration and exciting experiences. Trade and commerce were however sole motivating factor in the ancient past, which made people travel to distant lands to seek fortunes. Travel got a big boost with the opening of the trade routes as travellers from distant lands started moving about in large numbers and visited many places for business purposes. Thus opening of new trade routes provided marketplaces to merchants and these trade relations matured into cultural relations and a better understanding of each other's way of life. Various arts, cultures and customs were exchanged and science, technology, and religious faiths also experienced the influence of each other.",

The economy of many countries like Singapore, Thailand France etc. is solely based on tourism. One of the major characteristics of modern society is the emergence of the phenomenon of travel and tourism on a mass scale. Almost all inventions and innovations in the world have in some way contributed to the increased ability of people to travel. Today, people talk of visiting capitals and exotic places around the world almost as an every day happened stance. Our world has become a world where countries and communities are in contact with each other. Today, tourism is at its peak. It is more highly developed than it has ever been.",

Some of the places which were familiar among pilgrims of Hindu and Buddhists become notable centres of mass visitors to modern India.",
    "pleasure_and_holiday_description": "The Romans probably were the first pleasure travellers in the world. Travel became quite sophisticated by the time Christ was born. There are reasons to believe that pleasure travel also developed at the same time in China, India and Japan. The Romans used to travel up to a hundred miles a day by using relays of horses, taken from rest posts five to six miles apart. They travelled to see the temples in the Mediterranean area and the Pyramids of Egypt. They also journeyed to medicinal baths, called \"spas\", and seaside resorts. The Roman Empire had an excellent network of roads. Plutarch spoke of “globe trotters, who spent the best part of their lives in inns and boats.\" Persons of means travelled in little (littiga) four-wheeled wagons or chariots. Others used carts or public coaches. Some Roman cargo ships carried a few passengers. Private vessels could be marvellously luxurious. The vessel that carried the beautiful queen Cleopatra to meet Mark Antony reportedly had billowing scarlet silk sails, silver-tipped oars, and decks draped with royal purple cloth. Holiday tourism was also on the cards during ancient times but this was given a new shape in the nineteenth century by Thomas Cook when he introduced the concept of 'Organized Tour\".",

Earlier there was a lot of competition among countries but now they are opting for intelligent cooperation. Product was the major dominating factor in old tourism, which is now based on customer orientation.",
    "Diversification in Products": "Earlier travel was limited to the natural environment people were interested in a single activity and the biggest constraint on tourism was seasonality. Now the product has changed to an artificial environment and people are opting for multiple activity-based tours. Modern tourism is now has taken the shape of all seasons of tourism.",
    "Diversification in Developer Control": "The developer's control over tourism has also changed with time. There was the time of political lobbying, which now changed to approvals via referendum. These days' developers are giving more importance to jobs and small businesses rather than just going for more and more economic impacts of tourism. We have changed our focus from environment protection to environment improvement. Earlier tourist arrival was considered as cultural intrusion, where as it is now considered as a major force for heritage protection.",

Throughout the course of history, people have travelled for purposes of trade, religious conviction, economic gain, war, migration and other equally compelling motivations. In the Roman era, wealthy aristocrats and high government officials travelled for pleasure and recreation across Europe and Asia. Seaside resorts located at Pompeii and Herculaneum afforded citizens the opportunity to escape to their vacation villas to avoid the summer heat of Rome. Travel, except during the Dark Ages, has continued to grow, and throughout recorded history, has played a vital role in the development of civilizations.",
    "paragraph_3": "Tourism as we know it today is distinctly a twentieth-century phenomenon. Historians suggest that the advent of mass tourism began in England during the industrial revolution with the rise of the middle class and relatively inexpensive transportation. The creation of the commercial airline industry following the Second World War and the subsequent development of jet aircraft in the 1950s signalled the rapid growth and expansion of international travel. This growth led to the development of the tourism industry. Today tourism has become a concern of several countries since it not only provides new employment opportunities, but it also produces foreign exchange.",

Is there a large enough market to support such a project, be it a hotel, restaurant, or theme park?

Consequently, with proper planning, tourism can be an effective protector of the environment. WTO forecasts that international tourism will double by the year 2010, to nearly one billion arrivals a year. While this rapid growth will provide many opportunities for prosperity, it will also put a tremendous strain on tourism destinations: on beaches and mountain resorts; on small islands; on historic city centres; and picturesque villages.

    "attraction_destination_image": "the attraction of a destination lies in the image that the potential tourist has of a particular place. The image of a destination depends on a variety of factors like attitude of the host population, civic amenities, natural surroundings, accessibility, food, etc. The image is neither constructed nor deconstructed overnight. It tends to build up over time. No destination can be popular unless it is accessible and offers services and amenities that the tourists demand. Essential services are accommodation and food, backed up by local transport, activities and entertainment. The development of a tourist destination is not an independent product rather is an amalgam of several products acting as components. The element of intangibility is a crucial one to the destination. Perishability, seasonality, inseparability and heterogeneity, the characteristics of tourism products, have much relevance in the core of tourism destinations also. As explained earlier, a tourism destination, apart from just a place, comprises different components or elements. All such elements can be summarized into four groups, usually represented as 4 As. These represent Attraction, Accessibility, Amenities and Ancillary services, Let us go into the details of each element.",
    "a_Attractions": "The explanation for attraction is given earlier. Attractions are the heart of the tourism industry. They are acting as motivators that make people want to take trips. Generally, attractions are classified as either natural or man-made. Further classifications also be possible, man-made attractions not designed to attract tourists (e.g.: Cathedrals, Archeological sites), man-made attractions designed to attract tourists (Eg. Theme parks, Zoos), special events and festivals, complete natural environment attractions (eg. Beaches, seas, rivers), etc. Attractions have the 'pull' capacity by which tourists will be stimulated to engage in tourism and visit the particular place.",
    "b_Accessibility": "Accessibility refers to the easiness of reaching a destination. A destination must be accessible if it is to facilitate visits from tourists.

Tourists can purchase goods and services from the host country by paying accepted international currencies. Thus, the consumption of tourism products will generate activity, which can be compared to export, even though most of the tourism products are intangible in nature.

This will affect labour in the primary sector, which may suffer from a lack of enough skilled labour. This will raise the cost of labour and ultimately the production cost.

Middle Ages, for the first time, observed the emergence of a new class of travellers, i.e., adventures and explorers. Strongly motivated by 'curiosity' and 'quest for knowledge', these inquisitive souls, despite their limited means, used to set out on long and arduous voyages, bravely facing the en route risks and discomforts. Thus, daring spirits like Marco Polo, Columbus and Vasco-de-Gama added new dimensions to travel, in terms of activity, concept and philosophy. Renaissance in Europe followed by Grand Tours and subsequently, the development of spas, beaches and resorts as health destinations gave further momentum to travel and tourism. In fact with the varying socio-cultural, economic, environmental, political and technological dimensions the motivations and determinants have kept on, and will continue to be highly dynamic.",

Whenever we take a travelling decision we have clear-cut or well-defined reasons to leave our place (s) and, concurrently the options in the form of destinations. As discussed in the first part of this Unit, the reasons to leave our place are described as push factors, while the options form a gamut of what have been described as pull factors. In the second part inspirations behind the touristic pursuits, along with the stimulating factors have been discussed in detail. To have an insight into this, the classification of the motivational factors suggested by McIntosh, in addition to Fantasy, was taken as the major criteria. This included four categories of motivators, viz. Cultural, Physical, Inter-Personal and Status and Prestige. In the succeeding fraction, the very pre-requisites, i.e. the basic requirements; which are necessarily needed to be fulfilled by any person to qualify as a tourist; have been discussed. In simpler words, the role and importance of money, time, need or desire and social approval have been highlighted, which are must for the phenomenon of tourism to occur. In the last part, all the variables related to society, economy, technology etc. that might influence the demand and supply in the field of tourism have been discussed. These include population, income, state-of-the-art in the field of technology and cost of production – to name a few. These variables are commonly known as determinants and are indicative of the levels of qualitative and quantitative demand and supply.",

    "Now, based on the detailed study above, it can be concluded that infrastructure is the backbone of any destination. This is because it not only enhances the quality of life for locals but also ensures a comfortable experience for tourists visiting the destination. Infrastructure serves both locals and tourists, while the superstructure is exclusively utilized by tourists. The presence of both structures makes a tourist destination highly sought after.": "",
    "A destination with excellent infrastructure but lacking tourist attractions still holds a positive image among travellers. For instance, countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland, and other European nations are known for their cleanliness and world-class infrastructural facilities. On the contrary, countries with a wealth of attractions but inadequate infrastructure struggle to attract a significant number of tourists. India serves as an example, possessing a variety of natural and man-made tourist attractions. However, the initial lack of well-maintained roads, 24-hour electricity, and proper garbage disposal facilities deterred international tourists from visiting in substantial numbers.": "",
